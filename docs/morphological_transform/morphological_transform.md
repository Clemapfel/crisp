## 1. Introduction

A morphological transform is a function in mathematical morphology that alters the topology of a 2D region. In image processing, it does this by sliding what's called a *structuring element* across an image, altering the image in a way that depends on the structuring element, similar to a [spatial filter](../spatial_filters/spatial_domain_filtering.md). Unlike filter kernels, however, structuring elements have more than just a numeric type.

## 2. Structuring Element

## 2.1 Foreground, Background and "Don't Care" Elements

A *flat* structuring element is a n*n matrix, where each element can have exactly one of the following three values: 
+ *background* elements interact with image pixels that have a value equal to `0` or `false` for binary images
+ *foreground* elements interact with image pixel values in `(0, 1]` (where the 0 is excluded) or `true` for binary images.
+ *don't care* elements match any image value, similar to the joker in a card game

Image values that are ``< 0`` will be treated as background, values `> 1` as foreground, however this has no basis in mathematical morphology and morphologically transforming images with values outside `[0, 1]` should be avoided.

Internally, ``crisp`` uses an ``std::optional<bool>`` as structuring element components, where for each element `x` it holds that,
+ if ``x.has_value() and x == true`` it is foreground
+ if ``x.has_value() and x == false`` it is background
+ if ``not x.has_value()`` it is a "don't care" element.

Just like with filter kernels, ``crisp`` uses [Eigens matrix class](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__TutorialMatrixClass.html) for structuring elements, it is recommended to study their documentation before continuing.

## 2.2 Binding a Structuring Element

We use ``crisp::MorphologicalTransform`` for all morphological operations. First we create the transform object, then we construct the structuring element and bind it via ``set_structuring_element``:

```cpp
#include <morphological_transform.hpp>
using namespace crisp;

// in main.cpp
auto se = StructuringElement();

// create as all foreground
se.resize(3, 3);
se.setConstant(true);

// create transform object
auto transform = MorphologicalTransform();

// bind
transform.set_structuring_element(se);
``` 

We can access or modify the already bound structuring element using any of the following member functions of ``crisp::MorphologicalTransform``:

```cpp
// get reference to the structuring element
StructuringElement& get_structuring_element();

// access individual elements
std::optional<bool>& operator()(size_t x, size_t y);
std::optional<bool> operator()(size_t x, size_t y) const;
```

By default, the transform will be initialized with a 1x1 structuring element who's single value is "don't care".

## 2.3 Origin

Each structuring element `se` has an origin ``Vector2ui{o_x, o_y}`` where ``0 <= o_x < se.rows()`` and ``0 <= o_y < se.cols()``. The origin governs the alignment of the structuring element, similar to how a filter kernel is always anchored at it's center, the structuring element is always anchored at it's origin.

The origin is not an inherent property of ``crisp::StructuringElement``, instead we specify it using:

```cpp
auto transform = MorphologicalTransform();
transform.set_structuring_element(/*...*/);

transform.set_structuring_element_origin(1, 3);
```

By default, the origin is at the center of the structuring element. For structuring elements with even dimensions, the origin is instead initialized as ``(se.rows() / 2, se.cols() / 2)``.

## 2.4 Types of Structuring Elements

Much like with filter kernels, ``crisp`` offers a wide variety of structuring elements that can be modified, combined or used as is to fit any application. Like anything in ``crisp``, we can render the structuring element using ``crisp::Sprite`` and inspect it. Often structuring elements will be quite small, so it is helpful to scale the sprite by a factor of about 50 to more easily visualize them.

When rendering a structuring element, a foreground element will be shown as white rgb(1, 1, 1), a background element will be shown as black rgb(0, 0, 0) and a "don't care" element will be shown as gray rgb(0.5, 0.5, 0.5).

## 2.4.1 All Foreground

Using ``MorphologicalTransform::all_forgeround(size_t m, size_t n)`` we can create a structuring element of size `m*n` that has all it's values set to ``true``:

```cpp
auto se = MorphologicalTransform::all_foreground(5, 5);

auto sprite = Sprite();
sprite.create_from(se);
sprite.set_scale(50);
// render
```

![](./.resources/all_foreground.png)

## 2.4.2 All Background

Similarly, ``MorphologicalTransform::all_background(size_t m, size_t n)`` creates a `m*n` structuring element with all values set to ``false``:

```cpp
auto se = MorphologicalTransform::all_background(5, 5);

auto sprite = Sprite();
sprite.create_from(se);
sprite.set_scale(50);
// render
```

![](./.resources/all_background.png)

## 2.4.3 All "don't care"

Just like ``all_background`` and ``all_foreground``, ``all_dont_care`` returns a structuring element where no component has a value, they are all "don't care" elements.

```cpp
auto se = MorphologicalTransform::all_dont_care(5, 5);

auto sprite = Sprite();
sprite.create_from(se);
sprite.set_scale(50);
// render
```

![](./.resources/all_dont_care.png)

Recall that "don't care" elements are shown in gray.

## 2.4.4 Circle

``circle(size_t size)`` returns an element in the shape of a circle with radius ``size / 2``, all non-circle elements are set to "don't care":

```cpp
auto se = MorphologicalTransform::circle(250);

auto sprite = Sprite();
sprite.create_from(se);
// render
```

![](./.resources/circle.png)

## 2.4.5 Diamond

``diamond(size_t size)``has the shape of a square with side of length `sqrt(size)`, rotated 45Â°:

```cpp
auto se = MorphologicalTransform::diamond(250);

auto sprite = Sprite();
sprite.create_from(se);
// render
```

![](./.resources/diamond.png)

## 2.4.6 Cross

``cross(size_t size)`` has the shape of a two lines intersecting at the center of the matrix. Each line has a width of `1/3 * size` while all other elements are set to "don't care"

```cpp
auto se = MorphologicalTransform::cross(250);

auto sprite = Sprite();
sprite.create_from(se);
// render
```

![](./.resources/cross.png)

## 3. Transform Functions

Now that we know how to generate and bind structuring elements, we can apply them to images. We will be using a circular structuring element of size 9x9 to transform the following 500x500 binary and grayscale images:

![](./.resources/binary_template.png)<br>
![](./.resources/grayscale_template.png)<br>


We take special note of a 1 pixel thick line in the bottom left quarter of the image

```cpp
const auto binary = load_binary_image((/*...*/ + "/crisp/docs/morphological_transform/.resources/binary_template.png");
const auto grayscale = load_grayscale_image((/*...*/ + "/crisp/docs/morphological_transform/.resources/grayscale_template.png");

auto transform = MorphologicalTransform();
transform.set_structuring_element(transform.circle(9));
```

## 3.1 Erosion

Erosion "eats away" at the shapes by thinning the borders, or, for a grayscale image, tends to reduce light detail and widen dark detail. A proper mathematical definition can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion_(morphology)).

We apply it using:

```cpp
transform.erode(binary);
transform.erode(grayscale);
```

### original (left), eroded (right)<br>
![](./.resources/binary_template.png) ![](./.resources/binary_erode.png)
<br><br>

### original (left), eroded (right)<br>
![](./.resources/grayscale_template.png) ![](./.resources/grayscale_erode.png)

We note thinning along all boundaries, widening of the hole in the circle, and the absence of the thin white line. For grayscale, we furthermore note widening of black elements and notable reduction of the "silver lining" around the original shape's boundary.

## 3.2 Dilation

Dilation "widens" shapes, or, for grayscale images, widens light features and reduces black features. Again, a proper mathematical definition can be accessed on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilation_(morphology)).

We apply it similarly to erosion, using:

```cpp
transform.dilate(binary);
transform.dilate(grayscale);
```

### original (left), dilate (right)<br>
![](./.resources/binary_template.png) ![](./.resources/binary_dilate.png)
<br><br>

### original (left), dilation (right)<br>
![](./.resources/grayscale_template.png) ![](./.resources/grayscale_dilate.png)

We notice that the 1-pixel line is now much wider, the hole in the center of the circle has reduced in diameter and, for the grayscale image, white highlights such as the spot on the top right 90Â° bend of the shape have been increased in size. 

## 3.3 Geodesic Erosion

To geodesically erode a shape, we first need what is called a *mask*. We will use the following mask:
<br>
![](./.resources/mask.png)<br>

Comparing the mask to the original image (shown in gray):

![](./.resources/mask_comparison.png)<br>

We note how the mask covers the hole. In some parts it is completely enclosed by the original shape, while in other parts, such as the elliptical and triangular regions protruding from the connecting bars, the mask's boundary goes outside the original shape's boundary. The 1-pixel thick line is not covered at all.

Geodesically eroding a shape means to erode it while comparing the result to a mask. Regions covered by the mask (where the mask is `true`) cannot be "eaten away", if we were to iteratively erode the image an infinite number of time, at some point only the mask would be left, and no further change will occur from that point on.

To do this using `crisp`, we first load the mask:

```cpp
auto binary_mask = load_binary_image((/*...*/ + "/crisp/docs/morphological_transform/mask.png");
```
and then apply it to the image by simply calling an overload of ``erosion`` that takes it as the second parameter:

```cpp
transform.erode(binary, mask);
```

![](./.resources/binary_erode_mask.png)

We note that the hole has not changed in diameter. Because the mask fully covers it, no erosion can take place in that area. The triangular region at the bottom of the shape now has a "bump" because the mask overlapping the original region prevented any further reduction in area. The 1-pixel line still disappeared completely, as the mask has no interaction with that region.

When applying geodesic erosion to a grayscale image, the mask also needs to be a grayscale image. Apart from this, it is analog to its binary version.

## 3.4 Geodesic Dilation

When geodesically dilating a shape we also use a mask, however instead of limiting reduction, the mask now limits growth. In any area where the mask is `false`, no dilation will happen, while in areas where the mask is `true` dilation is unlimited until it reaches the mask's boundary.

```cpp
transform.dilate(binary, mask);
```

![](./.resources/binary_dilate_mask.png)

We note that the diameter of the hole was allowed to decrease because it is covered by the mask. The triangular region again exhibits "bumps" where the mask overlaps with the shape, however the 1-pixel line has not changed in thickness. This is because it does not overlap with the mask and is thus in the `false` region.

## 3.5 Closing

The closing of a shape is defined as the erosion of its dilation. Closing tends to smooth out fine detail while preserving rough shapes:

```cpp
transform.open(binary);
transform.open(grayscale);
```

### original (left), closed (right)<br>
![](./.resources/binary_template.png) ![](./.resources/binary_close.png)<br>
<br>

### original (left), closed (right)<br>
![](./.resources/grayscale_template.png) ![](./.resources/grayscale_close.png)

In both examples the difference to the original image is fairly minor, we do note, however, how the concave bends where the triangular elements meet the central "bar" have been rounded. The 1-pixel line is still present, the black stripe along the transition of the radial gradient texture to the triangular bottom textured part was enhanced.

## 3.6 Opening

Similar to closing, opening is the dilation of the erosion of a shape. 

### original (left), opening (right)<br>
![](./.resources/binary_template.png) ![](./.resources/binary_open.png)<br>
<br>

### original (left), opening (right)<br>
![](./.resources/grayscale_template.png) ![](./.resources/grayscale_open.png)

Again the difference is fairly minor, the most notable is the absence of the 1-pixel line, this is because it was completely eroded first, any further dilation step had nothing left to dilate. Rather than the convex corners, we now see rounding of the concave corners, such as at the very left of the base of the shape. For grayscale, we note that the "silver lining" is much more dull and gray compared to the original.

## 3.7 Hit or Miss Transform

While mathematically related, the [hit-or-miss transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit-or-miss_transform) (HMT) in practice is rarely used to alter the shape of a region. It can best be thought of as a method of detecting patterns in an image. Let's consider the following image first:<br>

![](./.resources/hmt_template.png)

We note a note thick, white lines and small cross-shaped elements around the image. HMT can be used to identify the position of patterns that have the same shape as the structuring element. We first need to create a structuring element that looks like one of the small crosses:

```cpp
auto cross = StructuringElement();
cross.resize(7, 7);
cross <<  0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0,
          0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0,
          0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0,
          1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
          0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0,
          0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0,
          0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0;
```
This matrix is different from ``cross(5, 5)`` because the non-cross elements here are background, rather than "don't care". We can now call the hit-or-miss transform:

```cpp
auto image = load_binary_image("/home/clem/Workspace/crisp/docs/morphological_transform/.resources/hmt_template.png");

auto transform = MorphologicalTransform();
transform.set_structuring_element(cross);
transform.hit_or_miss_transform(image);
```

![](./.resources/hmt.png)<br>

We note that everything except the origin of the crosses where they matched the structuring element were set to 0. It is evident how this can be useful for identifying the position of a pattern, corners or other regularly occurring shapes.

## 3.8 Pattern Replacement

Similarly to the HMT, this function also detects a pattern specified by the structuring element, however, instead of leaving a single white pixel at the correct place and changing anything else to background, `pattern_replace(Image_t, StructuringElement)` takes a second structuring element and replaces any occurrence of the first with the second. All other parts of the image are left unchanged. 

Again working with our previous image:
![](./.resources/hmt_template.png)

We want to completely eliminate the crosses in this image. While our previous structuring element matched the very center of each cross, we now need to generate a structuring element that is exactly the same size as the crosses. After having written a lambda function to do so, we can call ``pattern_replace`` using the already bound structuring element and an all-black square the same size as the crosses:

```cpp
auto generate_cross = [](size_t dimensions) -> StructuringElement
{
    auto out = StructuringElement();
    out.resize(dimensions, dimensions);
    out.setConstant(0);

    for (size_t i = 0; i < dimensions; ++i)
    {
        out(i, dimensions/2) = 1;
        out(dimensions/2, i) = 1;
    }

    return out;
};

transform.set_structuring_element(generate_cross(11));
transform.pattern_replace(image, MorphologicalTransform::all_background(11, 11);
```
The resulting image is:

![](./.resources/pattern_replace.png)

Which clearly had only the crosses removed. It is evident how an operation like this can be valuable in post-processing binary images, such as removing noise and speckles after segmentation.
